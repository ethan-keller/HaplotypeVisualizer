# Ideas & Todo's

## State management

- React redux toolkit + Redux query (for easy api calls)

## Performance

- Preprocess layout on server. Python server subprocess runs js script (cytoscape) and returns json of layout (nodes and their location).
- Indexing datastructures (node to loc & loc to node). K-d trees?
- Front-end gets viewports (with buffer)

## Phenotypes

- Population graph gets colored per phenotype (with custom filters)

## Features

- Info card
- Location card (what position in the graph are you in?)
- Bookmarks
- Navigation (whole graph view + node density view)
